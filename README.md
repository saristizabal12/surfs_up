Creating advanced data storage and retrieval

Overview of the analysis: 

Deliverable 1: Determine the Summary Statistics for June
We used Python, Pandas functions and methods, and SQLAlchemy, weâ€™ll filter the date column of the Measurements table in the hawaii.sqlite database to retrieve all the temperatures for the month of June. 

Then, convert those temperatures to a list, create a DataFrame from the list, and generate the summary statistics.

Deliverable 2: Determine the Summary Statistics for December
Next we, filter the date column of the Measurements table in the hawaii.sqlite database to retrieve all the temperatures for the month of December.

After we converted those temperatures to a list, create a DataFrame from the list.
Last step we generated the summary statistics.

Deliverable 3: 

Results: 
Provide a bulleted list with three major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.
Temperatures in june were higher the mean temperature for the area was 75 degrees Fahrenheit

The mean temperatures for December were slightly lower it was 71 degrees Fahrenheit which meant that. 

The standard deviation of the data showed that there was positive correlation since it was a pretty even bell curve.

Summary: 
Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional queries that you would perform to gather more weather data for June and December.
Since,we have a pretty even bell curve and the temperatures in June and December are pretty similar in the area.
It is safe to say that we can open up all year round. There is only around a 3 degree difference comparing the two months.
