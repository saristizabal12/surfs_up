Creating advanced data storage and retrieval

Overview of the analysis: 

Deliverable 1: Determine the Summary Statistics for June
We used Python, Pandas functions and methods, and SQLAlchemy, weâ€™ll filter the date column of the Measurements table in the hawaii.sqlite database to retrieve all the temperatures for the month of June. 

Then, convert those temperatures to a list, create a DataFrame from the list, and generate the summary statistics.

Deliverable 2: Determine the Summary Statistics for December
Next we, filter the date column of the Measurements table in the hawaii.sqlite database to retrieve all the temperatures for the month of December.



After we converted those temperatures to a list, create a DataFrame from the list.
Last step we generated the summary statistics.

Deliverable 3: A written report for the statistical analysis (README.md)

Results: 
Provide a bulleted list with three major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.

Summary: 
Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional queries that you would perform to gather more weather data for June and December.
